# click-app cookiecutter template

Cookiecutter template for creating new [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) command-line tools.

Use this template on your own machine with cookiecutter, or create a brand new repository based on this template entirely through the GitHub web interface using [click-app-template-repository](https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-repository).

## Installation

You'll need to have [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) installed. I recommend pipx for this:

    pipx install cookiecutter

Regular `pip` will work OK too.

## Examples

Three examples of tools that were initially created using this template:

- [shot-scraper](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper): A comand-line utility for taking automated screenshots of websites
- [s3-credentials](https://github.com/simonw/s3-credentials): A tool for creating credentials for accessing S3 buckets
- [git-history](https://github.com/simonw/git-history):  Tools for analyzing Git history using SQLite

## Usage

Run `cookiecutter gh:simonw/click-app` and then answer the prompts. Here's an example run:

    $ cookiecutter gh:simonw/click-app
    app_name []: click app template demo
    description []: Demonstrating https://github.com/simonw/click-app
    hyphenated [click-app-template-demo]: 
    underscored [click_app_template_demo]: 
    github_username []: simonw
    author_name []: Simon Willison

I strongly recommend accepting the suggested value for "hyphenated" and "underscored" by hitting enter on those prompts.

This will create a directory called `click-app-template-demo` - the tool name you enter is converted to lowercase and uses hyphens instead of spaces.

See https://github.com/simonw/click-app-template-demo for the output of this example.

## Developing your command-line tool

Having created the new structure from the template, here's how to start working on the tool.

If your tool is called `my-new-tool`, you can start working on it like so:

    cd my-new-tool
    # Create and activate a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Install dependencies so you can edit the project:
    pip install -e '.[test]'
    # With zsh you have to run this again for some reason:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Confirm your tool can be run from the command-line
    my-new-tool --version

You should see the following:

    my-new-tool, version 0.1

You can run the default test for your tool like so:

    pytest

This will execute the test in `tests/test_my_new_tool.py`.

Now you can open the `my_new_tool/cli.py` file and start adding Click [commands and groups](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/commands/).

## Creating a Git repository for your tool

You can initialize a Git repository for your tool like this:

    cd my-new-tool
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial structure from template"
    # Rename the 'master' branch to 'main':
    git branch -m master main

## Publishing your tool to GitHub

Use https://github.com/new to create a new GitHub repository sharing the same name as your tool, which should be something like `my-new-tool`.

Push your `main` branch to GitHub like this:

    git remote add origin git@github.com:YOURNAME/my-new-tool.git
    git push -u origin main

The template will have created a GitHub Action which runs your tool's test suite against every commit.

## Publishing your tool as a package to PyPI

The template also includes a `publish.yml` GitHub Actions workflow for publishing packages to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), using [pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish).

To use this action, you need to create a PyPI account and [configure a Trusted Publisher](https://til.simonwillison.net/pypi/pypi-releases-from-github) for this package.

Once you have created your account, navigate to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/ and create a "pending publisher" for the package. Use the following values:

- **PyPI Project Name:** The name of your package
- **Owner:** Your GitHub username or organization - the "foo" in `github.com/foo/bar`
- **Repsitory name:** The name of your repository - the "bar" in `github.com/foo/bar`
- **Workflow name:** `publish.yml`
- **Environment name:** `release`

Now, any time you create a new "Release" on GitHub the Action will build your package and push it to PyPI.

The tag for your release needs to match the `VERSION` string at the top of your `pyproject.toml` file. You should bump this version any time you release a new version of your package.
